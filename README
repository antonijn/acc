	The Antonie/antonijn C Compiler.

acc is a cross-platform multi-target C compiler.

acc is designed with a strong focus on:

	- 100% self-hosting ability
	- Readability and documentation
	- Performance without cutting corners
	- Full C90 and C99 compliance
	- A multitude of extensions
	- Reliability under any circumstances
	- Portability to any platform
	- Supporting multiple CPUs
	- Teamwork

I'm currently writing it partially for a school project, and for that reason
pull-requests will only be accepted after January 1st 2015.
