	Finding Your Way Around the src/emit/ Subsystem

The emission subsystem is the part where the actual generation occurs. It takes
input from the intermediate subsystem, analyses it further as required
(unimplemented as of yet), performs register allocation analysis (unimplemented
as of yet), and starts writing the target assembly.

The file /src/emit/asm.c provides an interface for writing assembly code.
emit_i() and emit_sdi() are among the most important functions in the interface.
They are used to write a general instruction to a file, and write a source-
destination instruction to a file respectively. The latter is important in the
distinction between AT&T and Intel assembly for the x86 architectures, the
former writing the source first, the latter writing the destination first.

Emitters are generally specific to a specific family of architectures, since
they are similar enough to generate the same code, albeit with a different set
of registers for each CPU, and a slightly different intstruction set for each
CPU.
