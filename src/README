	Finding Your Way Around the acc Source Code

This is the main acc source code directory. Among the subsystem directories
there are the separate uncategorised tools. It also contains the acc entry
point.

The documentation for any subsystem can be found in the subsystem directory.
Here's a quick overview of the subsystems:

	- src/parsing/	Reading the C input files and generating the
			intermediate source tree.
	- src/itm/	The tools for the generation, destruction, analysation
			and optimisation of the intermediate source code tree.
	- src/emit/	Tools for generating and writing the target assembly
			language.

The following utilities exist in the main source directory:

	- src/list.c	Linked-list utility.
	- src/error.c	Error reporting utility.
	- src/option.c	Command-line option management.
	- src/ext.c	Extension management.
	- src/target.c	The tools for management of the target CPU and operating
			system.

All subsystems are brought together by src/main.c. Here's a general overview of
what it does:

	- Set up the locale to be culture invariant.
	- In debug mode, register the SIGSEGV handler.
	- Set up the environment for fatal errors (temporarily, this is later
	  handed over to the compilefile() function).
	- Initialise global command-line options.
	- Call compilefile() for each input file.

The compilefile() function does the following:

	- Reset the tokeniser to its original state (see the relevant section
	  in the src/parsing/ subsystem documentation).
	- Initialise the abstract syntax tree.
	- Set up a new environment from which fatal errors are handled.
	- It then pipes the output generated by the file parser into the target
	  emitter.
	- In debug mode, it also creates an intermediate code dump.
