	Finding Your Way Around the src/target/ subsystem

In this subsystem, different compilation targets are implemented, only one of
which will be used in each acc build ('make config' automatically selects the
appropriate target for the system built on).

A target is selected by creating a symlink /src/target/cpu to the appropriate
CPU directory from the directories in /src/target/cpus.

Each target in the /src/target/cpus directory contains information specific to
the CPU, most importantly they implement assembly emission.
/include/acc/target/cpu.h and emit.h in the same folder contain all functions
requiring implementations for each CPU.
