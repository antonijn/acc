	Finding Your Way Around the src/parsing/ Subsystem

The parsing subsystem provides tools for, and implementation of the file
parsers, statements parsers and expression parsers.

	- src/parsing/token.c
	Provides a buffered interface for tokenisation of C files. A lot of the
	preprocessor is also implemented cheekily as part of the tokeniser.

	It provides functions chkt() to check if the next token has a specific
	lexeme, chktt() to check if the next token has a specific type. chktp()
	and chkttp() provide the same basic idea but output the token if chkt()
	and chktt() would return true.

	gettok() gets the next token from the stream, and ungettok() puts it
	back.

	freetok() frees a token after it's been returned by gettok(), chktp() or
	chkttp().


	- src/parsing/decl.c
	Provides tools for parsing declarations, or anything that looks and acts
	vaguely like a declaration (basically anything that has to do with
	parsing typenames).


	- src/parsing/file.c, stat.c, expr.c
	Provide the parsers for files, statements and expressions.
