	Finding Your Way Around the src/itm/ Subsystem

The intermediate subsystem forms the bridge between the parsing and emission
subsystems.

Its features include:

	- Providing an interface for reading and writing the intermediate form
	  abstract syntax tree for the parsing and emission subsystems
	  respectively.
	- Analyse and optimise the intermediate form abstract syntax tree
	  (unimplemented as of yet).
